# Cache-Controller
A lightweight L1 cache controller designed for high-speed CPU-memory interaction. Implements a 32-Byte direct-mapped cache with configurable block size and write policy (write-through/write-back). Handles cache hits, misses, and replacement logic to reduce memory latency. Includes Verilog RTL.
